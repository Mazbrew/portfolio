## Portfolio

---

- This is my third attempt at making a portfolio
- I was very disappointed with the state of the other portfolio website and have decided to restart yet again

## Notes

---

- 18/12/2023

  - The theme this time around is black and white
  - Initially the challenge was to try and use a varied color pallete but honestly speaking you have no color sense
  - Maybe create a backend to retrive messages that i post to the site

- 28/12/2023
  - tried particlejs but do not like how it looks
  - using p5js now to create the fancy display for more customizability
  - removed certain animations to fit better with p5js

## TODO

---

[] Create custom assets for the site inspired by the notthing dots
[] Recreate my custom deskmap on the main page with some nice line drawing animations
[] create the mandel bulb point cloud based on coding train
