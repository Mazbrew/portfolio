## Portfolio
---

+ This is my third attempt at making a portfolio
+ I was very disappointed with the state of the other portfolio website and have decided to restart yet again

## Notes
---

+ 18/12/2023
    + The theme this time around is black and white 
    + Initially the challenge was to try and use a varied color pallete but honestly speaking you have no color sense
    + Maybe create a backend to retrive messages that i post to the site


## TODO
---

[] Create custom assets for the site inspired by the notthing dots
[] Recreate my custom deskmap on the main page with some nice line drawing animations
